## 1. Core Definition and Conceptual Foundation

### Generative AI

Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence systems capable of **creating new content** such as:

* Text
* Images
* Audio
* Video
* Source code

Unlike traditional ML models that perform **prediction or classification**, generative AI learns underlying data distributions and **generates novel outputs**, closely resembling human creativity.
